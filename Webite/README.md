## Website Setup 
Documentation is the lifeblood of any project, serving as its roadmap, its history, and its guidebook. It's the bridge between ideas and execution. Clear, concise, and comprehensive documentation not only ensures smoother development but also empowers users to harness the full potential of the project. Within this repository, you'll find my documentation, designed to explain how i have done things, and pave the way for an enriching experience while looking at this project."
